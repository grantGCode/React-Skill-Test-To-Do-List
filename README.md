Desktop & Mobile Examples:
In this week's skill test, you’re tasked to retrieve, render, and style a list of to-do list items from
the following endpoint.

https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos

The focus here is to perform the regular function of a front-end developer, which is to get data,
template said data (in JSX for react developers), and style data according to specifications
given to you by a stakeholder.

Stakeholders are typically UX designers; for our scenario, I’ll be the stakeholder telling you what
I’d like for you to build.

I need you to build the following (see the last page).
It’s a small to-do list derived from the endpoint at this document's top.
Technical requirements:

● Each to-do list task must be its component

● Each task must either have its background be ‘red’ if it’s completed or green if it’s not
completed

● The design must look good on desktop and mobile viewports
● Only render and style four tasks

It’s important to note that the exact color of red and green doesn’t matter.
